# ReBTC: The Next-Gen BTC Yield & Liquidity Protocol

ReBTC is an advanced Bitcoin-based DeFi protocol that enables users to earn yield on their BTC while leveraging additional financial utilities like borrowing, insurance, and cross-chain collateralization. Our protocol maximizes BTC efficiency through liquid staking (`lstBTC`) and decentralized finance innovations.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ✅ **BTC Yield Vault**
- Deposit **BTC, wBTC, or Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)** to earn yield.
- Funds are converted into **lstBTC** at a trusted custodian.
- Staking rewards are **auto-compounded** to maximize APY.

### ✅ **BTC Collateralized Lending**
- Borrow **USDT/USDC** using **lstBTC** as collateral.
- Automated **loan-to-value (LTV) monitoring** to prevent liquidations.
- Liquidation protection through an **insurance-backed risk management** system.

### ✅ **Instant Liquidity & Flash Loans**
- Instant **swaps between lstBTC and BTC** for liquidity.
- Flash loans for advanced DeFi strategies like arbitrage and liquidations.

### ✅ **BTC Insurance Pool**
- Users opt-in for **insurance coverage** when staking or borrowing.
- Insurance reserve compensates for **liquidations, hacks, or slashing risks**.
- **Automated claims payout** using smart contracts.

### ✅ **Cross-Chain Collateralization**
- Use **BTC on Ethereum to borrow stablecoins on Solana, Cosmos, etc.**
- Powered by **LayerZero, Chainlink CCIP, or Axelar** for cross-chain messaging.

### ✅ **Institutional Vaults**
- High-yield vaults tailored for **DAOs, hedge funds, and large BTC holders**.
- Automated **rebalancing** to optimize deposits and withdrawals.
